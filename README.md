This is a test assignment to StarNavi company

### Initial setup
I've simplified initial setup procedure to the bare minimum. You just have to fill .env file using .env.sample one.

You will need to fill public and private RSA keys. You can generate them here:

Please, don't forget to remove `--- BEGIN KEY ---` and `--- END KEY ---` sections from the resulting string. Also, the string should be formatted as a single line.
