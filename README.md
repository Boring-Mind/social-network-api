# Social Network API
This is a test assignment to StarNavi company

### Initial setup
I've simplified initial setup procedure to the bare minimum. You just have to fill .env file using .env.sample one.

You will need to fill public and private RSA keys. You can generate them here:

If you have any issues with RSA keys, please use one inserted to .env.sample file. They are already proven to work.
